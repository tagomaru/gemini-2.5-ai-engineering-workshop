    "[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) is a developer platform that allows you to quickly experiment with Google's Gemini models. It provides a user-friendly interface for crafting and testing prompts, adjusting model parameters, and then easily exporting the code to integrate into your applications. It's a great way to prototype and explore the capabilities of Google's AI models before diving into coding with the SDK. You'll use it in this workshop to get your API Key.\n",
